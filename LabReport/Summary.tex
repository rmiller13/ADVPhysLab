\section{Summary}
%Summarize, in a paragraph or two, what you conclude from the results of your
%experiment and whether they are what you expected them to be. Include brief
%answers to the specific questions asked in the lab instructions.

Throughout the course of this experiment, we discovered that interferometers are
more structurally simple than the thought, and much more sensitive than we had
anticipated.   


\subsection{Responses}
\begin{description}
    \item[Question 1] \hfill \\
        The visibility of this interferometer is 1.02, as calculated in
        Section~\ref{sec:results}.
    \item[Question 2] \hfill \\
        The experimental result shows that our laser has a wavelength of 732
        $nm$, a 15.82\% error when compared with the actual wavelength listed of
        632 $nm$.
    \item[Question 3] \hfill \\
        The action of striking or leaning on the table causes vibrations and
        deformations in the table's surface, changing the path length between
        each leg of the interferometer. This changes the phase difference
        between each leg, creating interference, and thus, fringes.
