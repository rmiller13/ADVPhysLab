\section{Remarks}
%Please critique the experiment as presented in the lab manual. Could the lab be done in a better way? Do you have some other or original method for obtaining the same results? Your suggestions are encouraged and are used to improve the lab manual.

This lab definitely needs some improvement, should it be presented in this way again. With the addition of the lab manual building an interferometer will certainly be easier, however, having all the correct parts really is a must.  We had to borrow many pieces from the optics lab and even had to order some new parts. Time was a factor here, and had we more time we might have been able to create other experiments for students to test.  However all that being said, we were able to build an interferometer, align and measure changes in the interference pattern.
