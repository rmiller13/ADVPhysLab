\begin{abstract}
The objective of this experiment was to assemble a Michelson Interferometer,
experiment with different ways of viewing the interference patterns, and explore
methods of measuring the alignment and achieving optimum alignment. We were able
to properly construct and align our Michelson Interferometer, achieving a
visibility close to 1.

\section{Theory}

\input{./Theory}
%The purpose of this experiment is to measure\ldots

%Start with the motivation (or reason) for the experiment. Follow this with the theory behind the experiment. Give a brief presentation, in your own words, of the essential ideas behind the experiment. Include only the most important formulas (explaining the meaning of any symbols used). Do not give any derivations unless they are original. The purpose is just to establish the context of the experiment and state, for reference, the relations you will be using in analyzing your data. (The proverbial interested reader should be able to look up details elsewhere on the basis of your outline.) One paragraph, in good English, should suffice.

\input{./Description.tex}

\section{Measurements}
%Write down, preferably in tabular form, every measurement you took and what was taken into account in the following results section.

\begin{tabular*}{1.16\textwidth}{| @{\hspace{.5cm}}r | @{\hspace{.5cm}}r | @{\hspace{.5cm}}r | @{\hspace{.5cm}}r 
				|@{\hspace{.5cm}}r  | @{\hspace{.5cm}}r | @{\hspace{.5cm}}r | @{\hspace{.5cm}}r || @{\hspace{.5cm}}r |}
	\hline
	$\Delta V_1$ & $\Delta V_2$ & $\Delta V_3$ & $\Delta V_4$ & $\Delta V_5$ & $\Delta V_6$ & 
	$\Delta V_7$ & $\Delta V_8$ & Avg $\Delta V$ \\
    \hline 
	6.0 V & 6.4 V & 5.4 V & 5.6 V & 6.6 V & 7.2 V & 3.6 V & 6.0 V &     5.85 V\\
    \hline
    6.2 V & 5.8 V & 6.4 V & 5.6 V & 7.2 V & 5.6 V & 7.0 V & 5.4 V &     6.15 V\\
    \hline

\end{tabular*}

\section{Results/Analysis}

\input{./Results}
%Lay out the calculations that you are doing, never present results without explaining how you derived them. For your own benefit (and for the instructor's sanity): BE NEAT! 
%When you present data ALWAYS include an estimate of the error and show how the error analysis was performed. Clearly state the results you obtain. Results should be presented in an organized form, such as in tables, charts and graphs, and stated in correct SI units. When appropriate, experimental results should be compared to theoretical predictions and calculations. Include the percent error when appropriate. Don't use terms such as "fairly close" and "pretty good;" give explicit quantitative deviations from the expected result. Evaluate whether these deviations fall within your expected errors and state possible explanations for unusual deviations.
